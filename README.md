# RAMEN ADVENTURES

This is a client project to rebuild the Ramen Adventures blog. There are 3 developers and 3 designers on this project. This project is a three-month sprint beginning on July 14th and at the end of September.

Below are a few photos of the blog before the rebuild, while still hosted and maintained on Blogger.

Our amazing UX designers conducted user research and interviews, created personas and created wireframes for the dev team to implement.
