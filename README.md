# RAMEN ADVENTURES

This is a client project to rebuild the Ramen Adventures blog. There are 3 developers and 3 designers on this project. This project is a three-month sprint beginning on July 14th and at the end of September.

Below are a few photos of the blog before the rebuild, while still hosted and maintained on Blogger.
